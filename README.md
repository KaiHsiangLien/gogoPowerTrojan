At the end of the semester, some students in the special topic course: Advanced Dishwashing (DW 687) found out that they are in the borderline of passing the course. However, Professor Mike is being very generous and decides to give five extra points to the student who shows up first on the final exam at 8AM. To get the “P” for this class, these students are going to compete for the first place without any hesitation. Game on!
